    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "During the past week, two significant advancements have been made in my summer research project. The first one is related to the development of next predictive models - specifically, I have successfully implemented a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and its more sophisticated variant, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The second big improvement this week was about bringing together different parts of our system into one unfied framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regards to the first advancement, the implementation of the RNN and GRU models has been a crucial step forward. These models represent an evolution to process sequence data, offering enhanced predictive capabilities compared to previous models. Building these models required a deep understanding of their underlying mechanisms, and their successful implementation marks a significant milestone in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second noteworthy accomplishment this week is related to the system architecture. After independently developing various models such as Bigram, MLP, WaveNet, RNN (and Transformer, which is currently in progress), I have started to integrate all these components into a single Python script along with two helper scripts. This consolidated framework will provide a command-line interface that allows users to effortlessly train and inference models on any given word collection. By selecting their preferred model and parameters, users can easily customize the system according to their specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week's work has not only advanced capabilities in terms of predictive modeling but has also significantly improved the user accessibility and efficiency of the proposed system. Looking forward, I aim to complete the Transformer model and fully integrate it into the unified framework, thereby offering an even broader range of predictive models for users to choose from.\n",
