# Name Generation with Autoregressive Character-level Language Modeling

The aim of this research project is to develop an AI-powered system that can generate new and unique names. The system leverages character-level language techniques, ranging from simple models like n-grams to advanced models like RNNs and Transformers.

This Readme file will be frequently updated as the research is improving.
The code for experiments and analysis is written in Jupyter Notebooks with markdowns and comments. These notebooks will be frequently modularized and be more structured. 


## Usage
Once the project is ready, it will require the followings for performing.
- Dataset of names e.g person, company, pokemon names
- Name of the model (several models will be implemented)
- Available Model Parameters
